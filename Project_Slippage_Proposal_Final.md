## A Crypto-Brokerage Solution to the Robinhood-Citadel Dilemma

Recently, the unusual trading volume of the common shares of GameStop, Inc. has shined a light on the evolution of the traditional brokerage business model. Historically, the primary revenue stream of brokerages and associated financial management firms were substantial commissions on the trades they processed and executed on behalf of their clients. With the advent of investor empowered internet trading platforms, investors have benefitted from a commission per trade race to the bottom from brokerages, many of which now have arrived at near commission-free trades to their clients. 

One alternative revenue stream is illustrated by Robinhood’s sale of customer order flow to market-makers, the primary sources liquidity in the US equity and options markets. As the Wall Street Journal reported, “Robinhood’s regulatory filings show the company charges large investment firms called “market makers” fees to [access real-time information about which stocks its users are buying and selling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/29/robinhood-citadel-gamestop-reddit/), a practice some regulators and industry watchers have seen as a potential conflict of interest.” Robinhood’s sale of customer order flow, specifically to Citadel Securities, has created significant mistrust and cynicism around what was intended to be a customer friendly fee mechanism, as it allows large institutions to execute transactions prior to that of Robinhood’s customers but with the knowledge of the broader interest in a given trade.

Our project will attempt to create a non-fungible token (NFT) that would be used at the point of order generation for each customer for each trade. These NFT’s would purely be used as a mechanism to encrypt the order prior to its execution, and thereby eliminating the risk that any other market participant could have advanced knowledge of customer interest. We would do so either by a service offering to existing brokerages or by creating a new brokerage with this unique value proposition as its distinguishing characteristic. The mechanism by which we pay for the per-transaction gas cost is still under consideration.
