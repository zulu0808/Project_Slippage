## Bye Bye Brokerage with Blockchain

The global financial system has extensive problems, unnecessary costs and fees, delays, redundant and time-consuming paperwork, which creates a system that is ripe for fraud and crime. To that point, 45% of financial intermediaries, such as payment processors, stock exchanges, and money transfer services, suffer from economic crime every year; compared to 34% of all other economic sectors combined, and only 20% and 27% for the professional services and technology sectors, respectively.  As the attempts and complexity of crime within the Financial Service sector continues to rise, the costs for more stringent regulations continue to climb, which consumers ultimately bear the burden.



This begs the question, why is our current way of conducting financial transactions so inefficient, and opportunistic for crime and how could we conduct financial transactions that would bypass these inefficiencies while creating more secure transactions?  We propose using blockchain for individual investors to bypass these inefficiencies of the current financial service transactions, creating instant, more secure, and anonymous way to make financial investments.
